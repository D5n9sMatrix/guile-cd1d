  "Requirements
Before diving into the internals, you should understand the formal requirements
and other expectations for GDB. Although some of these may seem obvious, there
have been proposals for GDB that have run counter to these requirements.

First of all, GDB is a debugger. It's not designed to be a front panel for
embedded systems. It's not a text editor. It's not a shell. It's not a
programming environment.

GDB is an interactive tool. Although a batch mode is available, GDB's primary
role is to interact with a human programmer.

GDB should be responsive to the user. A programmer hot on the trail of a nasty
bug, and operating under a looming deadline, is going to be very impatient of
everything, including the response time to debugger commands.

GDB should be relatively permissive, such as for expressions. While the compiler
 should be picky (or have the option to be made picky), since source code lives
 for a long time usually, the programmer doing debugging shouldn't be spending
time figuring out to mollify the debugger.

GDB will be called upon to deal with really large programs. Executable sizes
of 50 to 100 megabytes occur regularly, and we've heard reports of programs
approaching 1 gigabyte in size.

GDB should be able to run everywhere. No other debugger is available for even
half as many configurations as GDB supports."

The first edition of this document was written by John Gilmore of Cygnus

Over the years, many others have made additions and changes to this document.

  "Overall Structure
GDB consists of three major subsystems: user interface, symbol handling
(the symbol side), and target system handling (the target side).

The user interface consists of several actual interfaces, plus supporting code.

The symbol side consists of object file readers, debugging info interpreters,
symbol table management, source language expression parsing, type and value
printing.

The target side consists of execution control, stack frame analysis, and
physical target manipulation.

The target side/symbol side division is not formal, and there are a number
of exceptions. For instance, core file support involves symbolic elements
(the basic core file reader is in BFD) and target elements (it supplies
the contents of memory and the values of registers). Instead, this division
is useful for understanding how the minor subsystems should fit together.")
